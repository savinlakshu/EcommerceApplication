# EcommerceApp
This App was build for getting familiar with React-js Library, this project made me learn fundamentals of Library. For UI design Bootstrap and Material-UI are used. Notifications displayed after every User activity is acheived using a react module named React-Toastify. React-Context-API is used to handle currently logged-in user and prevent further props Drilling.
